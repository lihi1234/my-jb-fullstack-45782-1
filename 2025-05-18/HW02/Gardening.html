            Gardening is the process of growing plants for their vegetables, fruits, flowers, herbs, and appearances within a designated space.
             Gardens fulfill a wide assortment of purposes, notably the production of aesthetically pleasing areas, medicines, cosmetics, dyes,
              foods, poisons, wildlife habitats, and saleable goods (see market gardening). 
              People often partake in gardening for its therapeutic, health, educational, cultural, philosophical, environmental, 
              and religious benefits.

              Gardening varies in scale from the 800 hectare Versailles gardens down to container gardens grown inside. 
              Gardens take many forms; some only contain one type of plant, 
              while others involve a complex assortment of plants with no particular order.

             Gardening can be difficult to differentiate from farming. 
             They are most easily differentiated based on their primary objectives. 
             Farming prioritizes saleable goods and may include livestock production, whereas gardening often prioritizes aesthetics and leisure.
              As it pertains to food production, gardening generally happens on a much smaller scale with the intent of personal or
               community consumption.[4] There are cultures which do not differentiate between farming and gardening.
                This is primarily because subsistence agriculture has been the main method of farming throughout its 12,000 year history
                 and is virtually indistinguishable from gardening.

            Plant domestication is seen as the birth of agriculture. 
            However, it is arguably preceded by a very long history of gardening wild plants. 
            While the 12,000-year-old date is the commonly accepted timeline describing plant domestication,
             there is now evidence from the Ohalo II hunter-gatherer site showing earlier signs of disturbing the soil
              and cultivation of pre-domesticated crop species.
               This evidence pushes early stage plant domestication to 23,000 years ago which aligns with research done by Allaby (2022)
                showing slight selection pressure of desirable traits in Southwest Asian cereals (einkorn, emmer, barley).
             Despite not qualifying as plant domestication, many archaeological studies are pushing the potential date
              of hominin selective ecosystem disturbance back up to 125,000 years ago.
               Much of these early recorded ecosystem disturbances were made through hominin use of fire, which dates back to 1.5 Mya
                (although at this time fire was not likely being wielded as a landscape-changing tool by hominids).
                 This anthropogenic ecosystem disturbance may be the origin of gardening.

             Every hunter-gatherer society has developed a niche of some sort, 
             allowing them to thrive or even just survive amongst their environments.
              Many of these prehistoric hunter-gatherers had constructed a niche allowing for easier access to,
               or a higher amount of, edible plant species.
             This shift from hunting and gathering to increasingly modifying the environment in a way which produces an abundance
              of edible plant species marks the beginning of gardening.
               One of the most documented hominin niches is the use of off-site fire.
                When done intentionally, this is often called forest gardening or fire stick farming in Australia.
             The modern study of fire ecology describes the many benefits that off-site fires may have granted these early humans.
              Some of these agroecological practices have been well documented and studied during colonial contact.
               However, they are vastly under represented in research done on early hominin fire use.
                Based on current research, it is evident that these niches developed separately in different societies across different
                 times and locations.
                 Many of the Indigenous gardening methods were and still are often overlooked by colonizers due to the lack 
                 of resemblance to western gardens with well-defined borders and non-naturalized plant species.
