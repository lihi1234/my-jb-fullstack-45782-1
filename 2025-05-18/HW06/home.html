        <p>A programming language is a system of notation for writing computer programs.
            [1] Programming languages are described in terms of their syntax (form) and semantics (meaning), 
            usually defined by a formal language. Languages usually provide features such as a type system, variables, 
            and mechanisms for error handling. An implementation of a programming language is required in order to execute programs, 
            namely an interpreter or a compiler. An interpreter directly executes the source code, while a compiler produces an executable program.
